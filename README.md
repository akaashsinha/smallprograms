These are some of the programs I've done. They are done in Python 2.7, my goal was just to get my code out for the world to see!
To run any programfirst install python 2.7. Then download or copy and paste the code into a text editor and save it under the extension .py . Then go to your terminal/cmd, go to the directory it saved in and then run "python program_name.py
